Program 3 notes:

Recommended order:

1)	Get input from user on a loop, including parsing $$, as part of the prompt
2) 	exit command (don't worry about cleaning up background children yet)
3) 	cd command
4)	fork() + exec() handling
5) 	Input/output redirection
6)	SIGINT handling
7)	Background commands
8)	Finish exit command to clean up background children
9)	status command
10)	SIGTSP handling


Writing own shell, in C (any version of C):  smallsh
	-> allow redirection of standard input and output
	-> support both foreground and bg procs (controllable by the cmd line and by receiving sigs)

	Support 3 built in cmds:
			1) 		exit
			2) 		cd
			3) 		status
			comments, lines which begin with #
				-> ignore these, use strncmp

--------------------------------------------------------
The Prompt
--------------------------------------------------------

	:  symbol as a prompt for each cmd line
		-> flush out the output buffers each tine you print
			fflush(stdout)

	general syntax of cmd line:
		command [arg1 arg2 ...] [< input_file] [> output_file] [&]
			[optional]
		special symbols <, >, and &
        & as last character means run in background, else normal text

        -> max 2048 chars and 512 args
        	-> no error checking on the syntax of the cmd line
        -> allows blank lines and comments
        	# = comment line (ignore)
        	blank line does nothing
        		-> reprompt for another command



display ": " Then there command here
	-> cmds separated by a space
	* asprintf to allocate and store string

 gcc -o kosterkl.adventure kosterkl.adventure.c -lpthread
gcc -std=c89 -g -o kosterkl.adventureRev1 kosterkl.adventureRev1.c -lpthread




--------------------------------------------------------
Command Execution
--------------------------------------------------------

fork, exec, and waitpid to execute cmds
	when non-built in cmd is received, have the parent fork off a child
		-> does any needed i/o redirection before running exec on the file comd given
			dup2()







sighandlers get gutted during exec

and stays with the parent
