Program 1 - matrices - Notes
----------------------------------------------


Should be named: matrix
	general format of the matrix command:
		matrix OPERATION [ARGUMENT]  <- o and a are italic

	must do the following:
		1) matrix dims [MATRIX]
			-> prints dimesions of the matrix as rows, space, cols
		2) matrix transpose [MATRIX]
			-> reflect the eles of matrix along the diagonal MxN becomes NxM (diags unchanged)
		3) matrix mean [MATRIX]
			-> take MxN and return 1xN row vector. 1st ele is mean of col 1, 2nd of col 2, etc..
	* 3 above perform ops on file named MATRIX or on a matrix provided via stdin

		4) matrix add MATRIX_LEFT MATRIX_RIGHT
			-> take 2 MxNs and add them toegether element wise to produce MxN
			-> rtn error if matrices do not have the same dims
		5) matrix multiply MATRIX_LEFT MATRIX_RIGHT
			-> take MxN and NxP, produce MxP
				-> not commutative



Calc matrix operations using input from file OR stdin
	-> input = whole number value separated by tabs into a rectangular matrix

Script will:
	-> print dimensions of matrix
	-> transpose a matrix
	-> calc the mean vector of a matrix
	-> add 2 matrices
	-> multiple two matrices

Try reading up on when stuck:
	-> while
	-> cat
	-> read
	-> expr
	-> cut
	-> head
	-> tail
	-> wc
	-> sort


Required checks:
	-> given input file is readable, before attempting to read
		-> aka not a valid matrix (tab delminted table w/ at least 1 element)
		-> each ele is a signed integer
		-> every entry is defined
		-> table is rectangular
			-> examples:
					-> empty
					-> final entry row is followed by a tab char
					-> empty lines
					-> any element that is blank or not an int
		-> print something to stderr and rtn non zero value
